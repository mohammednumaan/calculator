# Introduction

The main objective is to create a simple calculator that can perform simple operations as well as complex chained operations.

# Implementations
<ul>
  <li> A simple Webpage.</li>
  <li> Ability to perform simple operations, <b>for example : 1 + 1 = 2</b></li>
  <li> Ability to perform complex and chained operations, <b>for example : 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42</b></li>
  <li> Ability to perform floating-point operations (complex/chained and simple).</li>
  <li> Ability to use keyboard inputs to perform calculations.</li>
  <li> Misc : DOM Manipulation Concepts and Flexbox concepts have been implemented highly in this project.</li>
</ul>

# Concept Map

This is a concept-map for the logic behind storing the user input based on simple and chained operations. (Note this is just a simplified map, certain things have not been mapped as it might be easier to understand by looking through the codebase.)

# Features To Implement In the Future

<ul>
  <li>Operations - to add more arithmetic operations such as <b>exponential (**)</b>,<b> modulous(%)</b> and much more.</li>
  <li>Floating Points - to perform calculations/operations upto 16 decimal places.</li>
</ul>

# Disclaimer

<ul>
  <li>This project is not supported on mobile, it wasn't meant to make it responsive across platforms. The main objective of this project was figure out the logic to calculate/perform simple and complex/chained operations, and <b>NOT</b> to make it responsive!</li>
  <li>Using '/' operator on your keyboard will divide the numbers but also open a quick-find bar (in FireFox browser), be aware before you use keyboard inputs to especially divide numbers. (other operators work fine!)
  <li>The fonts used in this project is Summer 22 Wide Pixel by <b>Suolahti Type</b> from https://www.fontspace.com/</li>
</ul>

# Known Issues/Bugs
